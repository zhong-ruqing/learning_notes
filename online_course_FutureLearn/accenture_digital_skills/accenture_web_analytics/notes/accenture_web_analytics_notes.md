### What are conversions

- The point at which an audience that receives marketing messaging completes a desired action. For example, a website conversion could be a measure of the number of visitors that make a purchase on your website.

### Conversions measuring

- A good measure of conversions is the conversion rate, which is the number of conversions divided by the number of visitors. So the higher the conversion rate, the higher the engagement with your end users and vice versa. If the conversion rate is lower, then you should look into why it is lower and what you can do to make it higher. Maybe you need to look into changing the website layout or changing the placement of your products.

### Conversion types

- There are two types of conversion: **micro conversions** and **macro conversions**.

  - Macro conversions give you a general idea of how your website is performing. For a retailer, this might be how many sales transactions it gets for a specific product and what type of product. For an insurance company website, it might be the number of online insurance quotes.

  - Micro conversions are activities that precede a purchase on a website or another business objective. For a retailer website these would include signups for an email newsletter and account creations. If you had a blog for beauty tips, the micro conversion is number of users following the blog and then the macro conversion is purchasing the beauty cream that you talked about in the blog.

### The continual improvement process

- It involves gathering, reporting and analyzing data, testing possible solutions and arriving at an insight that leads to an overall improvement.
- An ongoing effort to improve products, services or processes. It consists of: collecting and measuring data, reporting data in an understandable format, analyzing data, testing solutions and overall improvement by repeating learnings from previous stages

# Using Analytics

- Describe what segmentation is and why it is a useful analytical technique
- Explain what benchmarking is and why it is important to add context to your data
- Describe how to create a measurement plan

## Web analytics techniques

### Segmentation

- A marketing strategy which involves dividing a broad target market into smaller groups with common needs interests, and priorities, allowing you to create a strategy to specifically target them. Segmentation allows you to separate and analyze subsets of your data. For example, you may segment your data based on consumer purchasing behavior, demographics or geographical location.

### Benchmarking /Adding context to your data 

- Benchmarking is an established point of reference against which something can be measured in order to compare performance or reliability.
  - ‘Internal’ benchmarking is setting expectations based on your own historical performance, and this historical data can be used as a point of reference to create KPI targets.
  -  ‘External’ benchmarking is adding context to your data by comparing it with data from the competitors in your industry. This allows businesses to understand how well they are performing and recognize areas that may need improvement.
- Benchmarking allows you to add context to your data to understand it by comparing it to another set of data.

### Measurement plan

- A document that contains the mission statement for your app or website as well as a description of the strategy and tactics you will use to achieve the objectives laid out in the mission statement. It will also include information such as the key performance indicators you will measure and how you intend to segment your data.

- 5 steps to create a measurement plan:
  1. Creating a mission statement 
     - Thinking about what is the most important thing. / Something to identify what is it going to be. / What is your company about.
  2. Determining your strategy 
     - How to actually go about doing that?
  3. Identifying key performance indicators (KPIs)
     - What are the tangible, measurable things that tell you, are you doing well against your mission statement and strategy?
     - measurable & relevant to the tactic
  4. Defining your segments
     - To segment the dataset to understand what applies to a specific portion of the sample, because it is hard to find a general trend over the whole sample. 
  5. Setting targets
     - After understanding what you are looking for, in terms of measurement and what segment you are looking for, then the targets can be set. The targets can be set against historical benchmark. You set the targets, so you can still measure how well you are doing on your KPIs, if you are actually following a strategy, and if you are achieving your mission statement.

## Assignment

> You work for a company which sells jeans. You sell the jeans online via an e-commerce site. You also have a Facebook page to help advertise your collection and promote related items, such as belts.

**Questions:**

Create a measurement plan for this company by writing your answers to the 5 steps below.

1. Write a mission statement.
2. What is the strategy and tactics to support this mission statement?
3. What metrics would you use for your KPIs?
4. How could you segment your data?
5. What will your targets be for your KPIs?

**My Answer:**

1. Mission Statement:  A jean only for you.
2. Strategy:  To offer a website which the customers can design part of the jeans and get the jean via post. With normal price, they can design some small parts of the jean, such as the decoration, with a higher price, they are allowed to add/change more. Meanwhile, using the Facebook page to advertise this website and do some promotion campaign. If the customers recommend the website to their friends, they can get a certain amount of coupons.
3. Metrics for KPIs: Number of views of the Facebook page / Number of visitors of the website / Number of sales / Sales per customer / Number of customers who recommend the website to their friends to get coupons / Number of second purchases 
4. Segmentation: Gender, Age, Size, Location, Occupation.
5. Target for the KPIs: (It's hard to set the KPI targets me before I really get some experience, I would rather set these after I do some research on the data of my own company as well as the competitors who offer similar service and to set the KPIs in a reasonable range. Also, the cost of producing such a jean as well as the post need to be considered.)
