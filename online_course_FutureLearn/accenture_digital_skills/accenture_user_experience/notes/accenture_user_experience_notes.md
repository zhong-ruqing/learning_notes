## What is UX

- **definition of UX** :  Also called UCD (User Centered Design). It's an iterative design process where we involve users and their needs within each phase of the design process to create usable and accessible products and services. ( Different from UI because UI is just User Interface. UX contains more, you need to consider who they are and what they need.) 
- **elements of the process** : 
  1. high level concepts *(understanding the problems and the opportunities that you've identified)*
  2. research on users *(to understand who they are, what they need, why they like and don't like, how they interact with your business / can be done by surveys, interviews, focus groups or workshops)* 
  3. iterating *(getting feedback from the users to constantly improve the design)*

## The foundations of UX design

5 steps (key stages in UX design):

1. **Discover:** Discover more about users and other relevant products.
2. **Describe:** Describe and define your concept. / What are you really trying to create? (IMPORTANT: To base your decisions around real data from real users.)
3. **Design:** Design the behavior.
4. **Develop:** Develop the design, add the details, the visual branding, and test on users.
5. **Release**: Release the product on site. And need to continually improving the design, do iterating.

## What is 'good usability'

1. Simple and easy to understand
2. Feels intuitive
3. Engaging - users should feel good while using it
4. Efficient - the fewer clicks to complete a task, the better
5. Make users feel supported
6. Make it easy to recover from mistakes
7. Consistency across different pages

Accessibility is also an important aspect of usability. In practice, accessibility is about designing products and services to accommodate the needs of all potential users regardless of their ability.

Keep asking "WHY" and "WHAT IF".

# Lesson 2: Understanding Your Users

> learning objectives:
>
> - Explain the ‘discover’ and ‘describe’ stages of the UX process
> - Explain why you need to interact with your users during the design process, the different ways of doing it and how to represent different user groups with personas
> - Explain how to scope out your solution by brainstorming with an open mind and clarifying your main goals and requirements

## User research - 'Discover'

user research methods:

- interviews with typical users
- surveys and questionnaires
- market research
- formal lab-based usability studies (can track people's eye gaze and emotions as they interact)

creating personas:

- describe different types of user 
- a profile of an example user,  a story about who they are, what motivates them, what brands they like or preferences they have, what are their pain points, or any other information that helps to characterize them

> [CREATE A GOOD USER PERSONA](https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/creating-personas/)
>
> [USER PERSONAS TEMPLATES AND EXAMPLES](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)

## Goals and ideas - 'Describe'

- start to find your solution by **brainstorming** with an open mind whilst clarifying your main goals and requirements
  - define goals
    - to be open
    - think of lots of different possibilities without going into much detail on each one
    - don't analyze or criticize at this stage
  - define requirements
    - prioritized list
    - help to check back against the brainstorm ideas

# Lesson 3: Designing the Experience

> learning objectives:
>
> - Describe the ‘design’ stage of the UX process
> - Explain what ‘user journeys’ are, and how to refine your goals and requirements into steps that are taken by a user to carry out tasks
> - Describe visual and brand design and its effect on user experience
> - List concepts of information architecture and explain the importance of good structure for usability
> - Identify the concepts and reasons for creating prototypes before building anything and the forms prototypes can take
> - Explain the how and why of drawing wireframes, the importance of low-to-high detail and the benefits of interactive prototypes

## User Journey

- after having fairly clear idea of what tasks users need to carry out, the steps they do to carry out these tasks are called user journey
- to clarify the function of each step, and how they link to each other
- alternate paths: think about how to handle these paths when the user is not on the desired user journey

## Visual Design

- 'brand' or 'graphic design'
- important things to keep in mind:
  - **Typography** describes what you use for writing text: body text, headlines, and buttons. This includes things such as font, text sizes, and colors
  - **Colors** are something you can use to draw attention or categories items, and color schemes are also important for your branding
  - **Image styles** are really important for the look and feel of your page. So are you using, for example, photography or a cartoon image?
  - **Spaces, shapes, and lines** are ways to construct and visually divide your page and can help add clarity or emphasis
  - **Symbols** are icons you can use for menus, user actions, or content categories – these should be familiar visual cues to help a user
- when to do visual design：
  - **early concepts**
    -  A polished brand theme, logo or sample page design can be helpful for demonstrating, communicating.
  - **during analysis**
    -  interactive prototyping
    - a visual way of defining how your site or app would work
    - starting with ‘low fidelity’.  (Low-fidelity designs are simple low-tech concepts. Keep your ‘functional designs’ simple and easy to edit, until you’re happy the functionality is agreed.)
  - **later in the design process**
    - making it ‘higher fidelity’. (High-fidelity designs are highly functional and can be interactive. They are very close to the final product.)

## Information Architecture - Structuring your site 

- Creating a structure for a website or application which allows users to understand where they are and where to find the information that they need. It focuses on organizing and labelling content in an effective way to support usability and help users easily find the information they’re looking for.

- key elements that make up a good information architecture:
  - Organizing
  - Labelling
  - Navigation
  - Search
  - Personalization

> [EIGHT PRINCIPLES OF INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE](https://www.futurelearn.com/links/l/htbpagk5iufwhj7fzw3voywa1t5ae4y)

## Prototyping

- focus on how it works in the flow
- ways to do it
  - on paper or card, sketch: can make changes easily and quickly
  - draw them with design tool

>
> [EXAMPLE OF A PROTOTYPE](https://fjord.invisionapp.com/share/KQF5Q86T7#/screens)

## Wireframes and interactive prototypes

- Drawing wireframes can help you plan what your app or website will look like. 

- Interactive prototypes can go from very basic wireframe style drawings through to a perfect replica of how your website will look. They're really useful to test the logic and flow and find any gaps or inconsistencies that you wouldn't have noticed with your static pictures.

# Lesson 4: User Testing

> learning objectives:
>
> - Explain what user testing is and why it is important to test designs with users
> - List some of the different types of user test, including task-based, real world and A/B testing, and how to perform them

## What is user testing

- Evaluating a product by testing it with a sample group of intended users.

- A good usability test is the process of measuring how well a product performs with real users by asking test participants to complete a series of tasks with a prototype. Usability testing is a task-based activity. No matter how you test (remote or in-person), you have to create tasks based on your product functionality.

> [ROCKET SURGERY MADE EASY BY STEVE KRUG: USABILITY DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UCDUOB_aS8)

## Different types of user testing

- Types
  - **task-based testing**
    - It is based on user journey which is described first, or alternate paths of the user journey.
    - **DO**: write out the simple steps that describe the goal of an activity and the data required. **NOT DO**: describe how to perform that activity. This is because you shouldn't lead the user at this stage.
    - **DO**: record errors that the user might make/ record their emotional reactions / ask them questions about how their experience really was (make sure to watch them do things rather than ). **NOT DO**: just listen to how they say they are doing things.
    - Usability can be measured using a standard set of questions.
  - **real-world testing**
    - Any type of testing when your app or website is actually tested by your end users.
    - Consider the real device the user use, the real condition the user is in.
  - **gorilla testing**
    - Go out into the wild, and speak to people. Give them the prototype and ask them questions.
  - **diary testing**
    - Give someone your prototype, and you let them take it home and use it in their daily life. And you ask them to record, in a diary, their experience of this as they go along.
    - It is a useful way to collect information over a longer period of time.
  - **A/B testing**
    - A/B testing (also known as split testing or bucket testing) is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app (A and B) against each other to determine which one performs better.

# Lesson 5: Developing and Releasing Your Design

> learning objectives:
>
> - Explain the ‘develop’ and ‘release’ stages of the UX process
> - Describe the final details of interaction design and how a knowledge of the technologies used to design and build can help you
> - Recall why it is important to understand user behavior by analyzing data after you launch

## Interaction design and useful tools

- prototyping tools
  - example: Balsamiq, Sketch and InVision (free), s Axure, Justinmind, and iRise (in bigger companies)
- Content management systems (CMS)
  -  what your website is built on
  - example: WordPress, Tumblr, Squarespace
- front-end development
  -  help you understand what's feasible to create
  - examples: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## The importance of analyzing data

- The real evidence comes from real life.
- The 6 useful data points to look at are:
  1. How are users getting to your webpage?
  2. How many users make a purchase (conversions)?
  3. Where are your users dropping out?
  4. How are your users navigating your site?
  5. How many of your users are bouncing?
  6. How much time is spent on each page?

# Assignment

### Instructions

In this course we have learned about user experience (UX), the foundations of UX design, and the design process. This assignment will help you to think about how you can create a good UX on a website or app.

**Answer the questions below based on:**

Either

- A customer website or app from a business of your choice, which you use to carry out an action, such as making a purchase or viewing media content.

Or

- Improvements you could make to an existing website or app from your own business, if you have one.

**Questions**

1. Good UX Design Principles - Write a short description of the website or app from your chosen business. - Does the website or app have any of the following good design features: simple, intuitive, efficient, engaging, supported, consistent, or easy to recover? If so, explain how it fulfils these good design principles and provide examples. - Watch the ‘What is ‘good usability’?’ video in Step 1.8 if you want to refresh on the design features!
2. Personas - Think about an example customer who might use the website or app. Write down the information you would include in a short persona about this customer. - Include the following: a fictional name and description of this customer, demographics, their background story, any other important information, and some additional sections you might include.
3. User Tests - Think about the persona you have created and why this person might want to use the app/website. Imagine that you are going to make some changes to the app to improve it. Describe the type of testing you could perform to test these updates, including why it would help and some of the tasks or observations you could include.
